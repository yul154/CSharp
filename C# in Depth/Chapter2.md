# Generics

.NET 1 had three broad kinds of collections:
1. Arrays -  statically typed, size is fixed at initialization
2. ArrayList - Not refer o the element type, Adding a completely different type will case InvalidCastException
3. StringCollection - statically typed, same logic only used in one type
